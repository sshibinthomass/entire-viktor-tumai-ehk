"""Cache-aware cost model on ESTIMATED tokens.

The export has no `usage` field: every token count here is estimated as
serialized chars / 4 (see load_trajectories.est_tokens). The cache trap still
applies: providers cache the shared input prefix across consecutive calls of a
task, and a model switch resets that cache — the first call after a switch
pays the uncached rate for the whole prefix.

Cached share of call i is estimated as the token size of the item-level prefix
that call i shares with call i-1 of the same trajectory.

Model ids in the export are anonymized (families claude-opus/-sonnet/-fable and
gpt-5.6-* across generations, e.g. claude-opus-5, claude-opus-4-8, gpt-5.6-terra),
so no public price sheet exists. DEFAULT_PRICING is an ASSUMPTION for relative
comparisons; unknown ids fall back to their family rate by prefix match — if a price sheet is posted in the
challenge Discord, put it in scripts/pricing.json; either way, state your
pricing assumption in the writeup.
